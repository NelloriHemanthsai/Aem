      <p>In a setback to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi High Court today stayed the trial court order granting him bail in a money laundering case. A vacation bench of Justice Sudhir Kumar Jain pronounced its verdict on a plea by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) seeking a stay on the June 20 trial court order.
        The High Court agreed with the ED's allegations that the trial court did not hear the probe agency properly.
        
        Arvind Kejriwal, also the national convenor of the AAP, was arrested on March 21 in a corruption case related to the Delhi liquor policy. </p>
